Last year I had the chance to work with two brilliant master students, Maria
Siller and Miriam Schlumpberger. They
wrote about the topic of wet and dry spells in the Tropical Andes of Peru,
from two different perspectives: synoptic climatology and high resolution
atmospheric modelling. Together their work form a nice story and I decided to
present it at the [EGU](https://www.egu2018.eu/) conference this year. Here is what came out:

The story doesn't end here (a further student is working on it, from yet another
perspective!), and I'd really like to write a manuscript about it by the end of
the year.

If you want to know more, here are the links to their theses:
