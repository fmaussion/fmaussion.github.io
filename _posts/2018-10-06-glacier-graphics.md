Last week I had to prepare a presentation for an audience with no
glaciological background. I wanted to explain some basic concepts
of glaciology such as **accumulation**, **ablation**,
**equilibrium line altitude** and **mass movement** in a glacier.

Since I'm no good at drawing and I thought that such graphics might be
useful for further occasions, I asked a professional graphic designer
(who also happens to be my sister) to make a series of simple
glacier graphics that I could click through while explaining the
concepts.

Here is the result *(click on the images for a larger version and to
scroll between them)*:

Although these are the first scientific graphics my sister ever made, I believe
she made a really good job!

Since these images might be useful to others, we decided to release them under
an [open license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). You'll find
all these graphics (as well as some other plots) on a
[dedicated repository](https://github.com/OGGM/glacier-graphics).

**Don't hesitate to leave us some comments here or on Github**! We'd love to hear
your feedback as well as improvement suggestions.

Thanks to [Kevin Pluck](https://twitter.com/kevpluck) from [Pixel Movers & Makers](https://pixelmoversandmakers.com/) we now have an animated GIF too!
