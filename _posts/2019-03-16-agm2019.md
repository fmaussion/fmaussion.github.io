*A guest post by [Lindsey Nicholson](http://lindseynicholson.org/2019/03/alpine-glaciology-meeting-2019-report/).*

Last week we were happy to host the [23rd Alpine Glaciology Meeting](https://www.uibk.ac.at/congress/agm2019/) at the University of Innsbruck.
The meeting was generously sponsored by the University of Innsbruck and the
Faculty of Geo- and Atmospheric sciences.

We had two days of glaciological talks and poster presentations, plus a chance to meet and network with colleagues.
The program can be accessed [here](https://www.uibk.ac.at/congress/agm2019/images/agm2019_programme_final.pdf).

Here are a couple of impressions:
