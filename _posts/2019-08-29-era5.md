[ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)
is the latest evolution of atmospheric reanalysis products. It makes a huge
step forward in terms of data quality and spatial resolution. Here is a map of
the topography used by ERA5 (at 0.25°, approx 25km):

This level of detail is unprecedented for a dataset of this type:
a perfect playground for endless data wrangling shenanigans!
Today, we have a look at **temperature trends at mountain glacier locations**
in the ERA5 dataset. By "mountain glaciers", I mean all glaciers except the
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (data source: [RGI](https://www.glims.org/RGI/)).

**Important note**: this is *not* peer-reviewed work. Code and data are available
(links in the last section of this post), but this work has not undergone
thorough quality check by other scientists.

## Glaciers are likely to be found at locations warming faster than the rest of the world

This plot shows the 40 years temperature change with respect to the
decade 1979-1988:

<a href="/images/blog/era5/era5_ts_global_glaciers.png"><img src="/images/blog/era5/era5_ts_global_glaciers.png" alt="Image missing" width="100%"/></a>

The temperature change at glacier locations (weighted per area, meaning that
locations with more glaciers have more weight in the timeseries) is stronger
than the average of almost a factor 3[^1].

[^1]: The exact numbers are: 0.18 ± 0.02 K per decade globally,
      0.44 ± 0.05 K per decade for glaciers, and 0.30 ± 0.03 K per decade for
      land areas.

So the question is: why?

## Why?

The best way to have a look at this question is to have a look at temperature
trends everywhere on Earth, and then at glacier locations in particular.

This plot shows the computed trends at each grid point, in units of °C per decade:

And this map shows where glaciers are located (source: [RGI](https://www.glims.org/RGI/)):

<a href="/images/blog/era5/era5_map_area_l.png"><img src="/images/blog/era5/era5_map_area.png" alt="Image missing" width="100%"/></a>

So, what do we learn from that?

### First, warming above land areas is stronger than above oceans (on average)

This has nothing to do with glaciers: oceans have a huge thermal capacity, and
the heat stored at the surface is transported via currents and mixed towards the
depths. If we do the same analyses as above but now over land areas only,
the picture is more nuanced:

<a href="/images/blog/era5/era5_ts_land_glaciers.png"><img src="/images/blog/era5/era5_ts_land_glaciers.png" alt="Image missing" width="100%"/></a>

The warming is *still* more pronounced at glacier locations than on land area,
but "only" of a factor 1.5.

### Second, warming is stronger at high northern latitudes

This is called "[polar amplification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_amplification)".
A good way to look at this is to have a look at the "zonal average", the
temperature trends averaged over each latitude band (here smoothed a little bit for
readability):

<a href="/images/blog/era5/era5_zonal_land_glaciers.png"><img src="/images/blog/era5/era5_zonal_land_glaciers.png" alt="Image missing" width="100%"/></a>
*Note that there is no data at latitudes where there are no glaciers or no land areas*

While most of the tropics and sub-tropics have an average warming of about 0.2°C per
decade, the warming goes up to more than 0.5°C at high latitudes (very visible
on the map above as well).

And **since the majority of ice area tends to be located at high latitudes,
this will move the global average towards warmer temperature as well**. Here is a plot
of the glacier area (in % of the total area) as a function of latitude:

<a href="/images/blog/era5/era5_zonal_weights.png"><img src="/images/blog/era5/era5_zonal_weights.png" alt="Image missing" width="100%"/></a>

I other words: 50% of the worlds mountain glaciers area is located north of
63°N, although this region represents only about 5% of the Earth's surface.

### Third: is there an elevation dependent warming?

[Elevation dependent warming](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2563) is
also a thing, but it is more controversial. However, it is worth mentioning
that there seems to be indications of elevation dependent warming in the
ERA5 dataset. Let's have a look at the warming at all locations above 1000 m
a.s.l.[^2], again as a function of latitude:

[^2]: 1000 m a.s.l. is arbitrary, and calls for a more quantitative and precise analysis

This shows us a more complex picture, but a few things come to mind (see also
the interactive map below where you can zoom):
- the glacier curve follows the "above 1000" curve quite closely at lower latitudes,
  not too surprisingly
- the warming signal is quite strong in the European Alps (50°N) and in Alaska (60°N)
- the signal in High Mountain Asia is visible on the map, but not on the zonal
  averages because of strong warming elsewhere at the same latitude

## A number of questions remain

- the analyses above are quite simplistic and qualitative, and would require
  a more in-depth analysis - maybe one of our master or grad student wants to
  tackle this?
- importantly: **if** there is an elevation dependent warming in ERA5, what are the
  processes at play? The newly released ERA5-land dataset might help to  
  understand what is going on.
- if this warming is real - how can we validate it? Mountain areas are notoriously
  sparse in weather stations, and ERA5 still is a modelled product (using a clever
  model, but still...)

These questions are left for the reader to answer! I'm happy to help if you want to
tackle these.

## Data and methods

The WIP code can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/fmaussion/52076a05f228a610024a84910d91b405).

**Data and methods**, in short:
- ERA5 is available on a global 0.25° grid, 1979-present
- when computing the  global average, we do correct for spherical earth
  (area weighted average). We also recompute our weights for land and ocean areas
- when computing the global glacier average for glaciated areas, we
  weight for the total glacier area per grid point
- glaciated areas are obtained from the [RGI version 6](https://www.glims.org/RGI/)
- for the trend computations we do nothing fancy: just a linear regression, no
  statistical significance test. Standard Errors are indicated in the interactive
  map above
- for the zonal plots, we smooth with a moving average window of 5 grid points

Analyses powered by [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org),
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/),
and the [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org) ecosytem.

**A cautionary note about ERA5:** although an awesome dataset and a
tremendous effort, ERA5 data needs to be taken with caution. It is the outcome
of the merging of observations and modelling (data assimilation), which does
not exempt issues with data homogeneity in space and time, and is not free of
uncertainties (especially in mountain regions).
