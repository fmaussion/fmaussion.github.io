In a recent study, [Zekollari et al. (2019)](https://www.the-cryosphere.net/13/1125/2019/),
computed the predicted volume change of all glaciers in the European Alps.

We display these data in the interactive plot below.
It shows the future evolution of Alpine glaciers' volume under various
emission scenarios, and for selected countries/regions. Glacier change
he change is displayed in % of their estimated volume in 2017. When hovering
with the mouse over each curve, you can display the data in plain text,
**as well as the estimated uncertainty** (±σ, indicating
that there is 68% probability that the future glacier volume will fall
within that range).
