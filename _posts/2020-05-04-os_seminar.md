This morning I recycled an old presentation of mine to give an online seminar
at the Austrian Society for Snow and Avalanches (short: [Ã–GSL](https://www.oegsl.at/)).

In this presentation I talk about open source and open science in general,
and how your scientific work can benefit from the tools and practices developed
by the open-source software community over the years.

The slides are available [here](http://fabienmaussion.info/oegsl_pres_os), and
here is a recording of the presentation and following Q&A:
