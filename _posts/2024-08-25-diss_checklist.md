You have one week left before submitting your dissertation! Amidst the latent stress (hopefully not panic!), the last-minute readings, and changes to your code and results, it's easy to overlook a few fundamentals of dissertation writing. However, these fundamentals are crucial for the reader and, likely more important to you, the grading of your work. Here is a checklist of relatively "low hanging fruits" — simple mistakes to avoid that could disproportionately affect your grade. These simple checks are much more important than, say, not being able to compute a very complex metric you want to add to the final figure of your paper.

These checks will ensure that the fundamentals of your dissertation are solid. This guide is intended for my postgraduate students at Bristol writing their final dissertations, but it should apply to most other student papers as well.

## Last Minute Checklist: Must Have

The checks below are non-negotiable. Failing to abide by these simple checks will most likely prevent you from getting an outstanding mark. They are very easy to avoid: just go through the list!

- **Stay Healthy**
  - Take regular breaks and long, deep breaths — a 5-minute break every 30 minutes makes you much more productive and settled.
  - Work in groups — it helps to stay motivated!
  - Back-up your work regularly. A loss of data could be devastating.
  - Check the submission guidelines to avoid last-minute surprises.

- **Check the Thesis Overall Formatting**
  - Title, name, study program, and formalities required by the university guidelines.
  - Section numbering ("Introduction" starts at "1", the abstract is not numbered).
  - Research questions (and hypotheses if relevant) are highlighted and easy to find (either bold or, more commonly, listed in their own subsection).
  - References.
  - Appendices (if any).
  - Uniform font, font size, and overall consistency. Keep it professional and sober.

- **Proofreading**
  - Grammar: use a word processor that highlights mistakes and typos.
  - Sentence length: could this sentence actually be two? (Yeah, most of the time it can).
  - References: are all datasets and methods you used referred to properly? Provide links to datasets, making sure the reader will understand what you've done.
  - Plagiarism: are quotes (if any) properly formatted and referenced?
  - Optional: have a friend proofread as well (proofreading is *not* writing for you).

- **Abstract**
  - Somewhere between 150-250 words.
  - It follows the overall structure of the thesis: big picture, motivation, what was done, main results and conclusions (one to three highlights), overall relevance, and, (optional) future research.

- **Figures Formatting**
  - All axes need labeling including physical units
  - Figures are numbered and ordered.
  - Figures have captions and, when appropriate, source.
  - Subplots within a figure are numbered (a, b, c...).
  - Curves or plot markers have legends.
  - Figures and captions are self-contained and self-explanatory.
  - Sample sizes are given in figures, legends, or captions if they can't be inferred easily.
  - Figures are mentioned in the text.
  - The order in which figures are mentioned is roughly consistent.

## Final Week Checklist

The checks below need to be done earlier in the process to allow you some time to act on them. At this stage, you should have most of the dissertation written (maybe?) or at least have lots of bits and pieces everywhere (more likely). One week before the end is the right moment to ask yourself questions of overall coherence and flow. If this is your final day before the deadline, you should probably avoid last-minute changes.

- **Remember the 'Hourglass' Model to Structure a Scientific Paper**, but remember that these are guidelines, not strict rules.

- **Research Questions**
  - Clear and specific? For example, there is a difference between the vague "Studying the impacts of climate change" and the more specific "Quantifying projected glacier change by 2100 according to CMIP6 SSP scenarios".
  - Researchable / achievable? Do they correspond to your results or will they raise completely unrelated expectations?
  - Analytical and testable? Can you revisit your research questions in the conclusions or discussions of your dissertation? If you can't or if your results do not relate to or do not advance knowledge on these, it's perhaps a sign that the research questions need redesigning.

Most importantly: have fun writing up your dissertation! I know it’s a stressful and difficult time, but you are almost there, and you should feel proud of what you achieved in these three frantic months. Congratulations on getting this far already!
