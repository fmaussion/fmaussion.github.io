Fabien Maussion is an Associate Professor at the Bristol Glaciology Centre, University of Bristol, specializing in the climate of mountain regions. His research integrates numerical modelling, data analysis, and remote sensing to understand past, present, and future glacier changes, particularly their implications for sea-level rise and water resources. He is the lead developer of [OGGM](https://oggm.org) (Open Global Glacier Model), an influential community model that informs international climate assessments such as the IPCC reports.

His research interests span diverse mountain environments, from the Tibetan Plateau to the Tropical Andes, and he has led multiple scientific expeditions in these regions. Fabien has led and contributed to several international research and glacier data infrastructure projects, most recently the [Randolph Glacier Inventory](https://www.glims.org/rgi_user_guide), [DTC-Glaciers: a Digital Twin Component for Glaciers](http://dtcglaciers.org), [PROVIDE](https://www.provide-h2020.eu/), and [AgroClim-Huaraz](https://agroclim-huaraz.info/). Fabien is committed to open science and education, and actively contributes to open-source software and inclusive research communities.

Before joining the University of Bristol, Fabien was based at the University of Innsbruck, Austria. He obtained his PhD in climate science from the Technical University of Berlin in 2014 and holds an MSc in Aerospace Engineering from ISAE-Supa√©ro in Toulouse, France. He is of French and German nationality.
