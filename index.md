I am an assistant professor at the
[Department of Atmospheric and Cryospheric Sciences](http://acinn.uibk.ac.at/),
 part of the [Research Centre for Climate](https://www.uibk.ac.at/climate-cryosphere/)
at the University of Innsbruck.

I&#160;specialize in the study of our climate system, in particular 
its atmosphere, cryosphere and how they interact. 
I do this mostly with the help of computer models,
but I don't mind going in the field once in a while as well.

Before moving to Innsbruck, I was working at the
[Chair of Climatology](http://www.klima.tu-berlin.de/index.php?show=home_start&lan=en/),
TU Berlin, where I obtained my PhD in 2014.
I graduated from the French aerospace engineering school
[ISAE-Supaero](http://www.isae.fr/en) in 2008.
