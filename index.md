I am an associate professor at the 
[Department of Atmospheric and Cryospheric Sciences](http://acinn.uibk.ac.at), 
University of Innsbruck. **In July 2023**, I will move to
the [School of Geographical Sciences](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography), 
University of Bristol.

I&#160;specialize in the study of our **climate system**, in particular 
its **atmosphere, cryosphere and how they interact**. 
I do this mostly with the help of computer models,
but I don't mind going to the field sometimes as well!

I am also active around the topics of **open science, open education, and open source**.
On this website you'll find infos and links to the projects I contribute to.
