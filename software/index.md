I like writing code and getting involved in open-source software development.
Here is a list of the projects I actively contribute to:

<a href="http://oggm.org"><img src="https://docs.oggm.org/en/latest/_static/logo.png" width="200"></a>

[OGGM](http://oggm.org) is an open source glacier model written
in python. Among other things, OGGM participates to the
[consensus estimate for the ice thickness distribution of all glaciers on Earth](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0300-3)
and the [Glacier Model Intercomparison Project](http://www.climate-cryosphere.org/mips/glaciermip).

<a href="http://edu.oggm.org"><img src="https://edu.oggm.org/en/latest/_static/logos/oggm_edu_s_alpha.png" width="200"></a>

[OGGM-Edu](http://edu.oggm.org) is an educational platform to learn and
teach about glaciers. It is a project inspired by OGGM but separate from it.

<a href="https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI"><img src="https://www.glims.org/assets/banners/glimsbanner.png" width="400"></a>

The [Randolph Glacier Inventory](https://www.glims.org/RGI/index.html) is a global collection of glacier outlines.
I am the co-chair of a [working group of the same name](https://cryosphericsciences.org/activities/working-groups/rgi-working-group/), and we developed [tools](https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI) and [datasets](https://rgitools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dems.html) for the RGI.

<a href="http://xarray.pydata.org"><img src="https://xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/_static/dataset-diagram-logo.png" width="200"></a>

[Xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org) is a Python library to handle labeled,
multi-dimensional datasets widely used in the geosciences.
Xarray is a fiscally sponsored project of [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/).


### High Asia Refined analysis (HAR)

<a href="https://www.klima.tu-berlin.de/index.php?show=daten_har"><img src="https://www.klima.tu-berlin.de/daten/har/pics/domains_wet.png" width="100"></a>

The [High Asia Refined analysis (HAR)](https://www.klima.tu-berlin.de/index.php?show=daten_har) is an atmospheric dataset I generated during my 
PhD thesis: the data is openly available. The dataset now has a little sister, [HARv2](https://www.klima.tu-berlin.de/index.php?show=daten_har2)

### Salem

[Salem](http://salem.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a small Python library to do
geoscientific data processing and plotting. It extends
[xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) to add
geolocalised subsetting, masking, and plotting operations to xarrayâ€™s
DataArray and DataSet structures.

### DownGlacier

[DownGlacier](https://bitbucket.org/fmaussion/downglacier) is an empirical
statistical downscaling (ESD) tool developed to retrieve glacier Surface
Energy and Mass Balance (SEB/SMB) fluxes from large-scale atmospheric data.
It can extend measured (or modelled) SEB/SMB timeseries
to longer time periods in a semi-automated manner.

### motionless

[motionless](https://github.com/ryancox/motionless) is a Python library that
takes the pain out of generating Google Static Map URLs.

### Other projects

See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/fmaussion) for other projects I contribute to.

In times not so far away I used to develop a bunch of tools with
[IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_%28programming_language%29), which are
available on request. My very first experience with open-source was for
my master thesis, during which I had the chance to participate to the development
of [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org/), an orbital dynamics library written in Java.
