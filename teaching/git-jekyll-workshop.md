title: "Workshop: create your own website with git and github-pages"

A nice and engaging website is a strong asset for your future job search. 
Fortunately, it is nowadays quite easy to make websites without much knowledge 
about HTML or JavaScript thanks to so-called [static site generators](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/why-use-a-static-site-generator/). 
They require a little more technical background than web-based content management 
systems like WordPress, but they are also much more lightweight and easier 
to handle (in my opinion). Furthermore, they allow to learn another important 
tool for scientists: the version control system [git](https://git-scm.com/).

Here are some example of static websites generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) 
and hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/):

- a personal website: [fabienmaussion.info](http://fabienmaussion.info/)
- a project website: [oggm.org](http://oggm.org/)
- an educational website: [transparency-lecture.github.io](https://transparency-lecture.github.io/])


In this **first workshop** (beginner level, about 3hrs), we are going to learn:

- how to create a website on github pages
- how to maintain it using git+github
- how to apply the git+github/gitlab workflow to your other personal projects 
  (like your programming code or your paper drafts)

In the **second workshop** (intermediate level, about 3hrs), we are going to learn:

- how to use git+github/gitlab for collaborative work
- how the work on major open source packages is coordinated on github
- how to contribute to open source packages

The two workshops are related but it is possible to assist to only one of them 
as well. Please be aware that a minimum working knowledge of a command line 
(or the willingness to use it) is a prerequisite for using both git and jekyll. 
The second workshop assumes that you already have some basic knowledge about 
git (e.g. obtained from the first workshop).


## Installation instructions (Workshop 1)

If you wish to actively participate during the workshop (highly recommended,
regardless if you wish to build a website or not), you will have to bring 
your own laptop and install git and jekyll prior to the event. 
Both tools are fairly easy to install and should 
work on all three major operating systems (Windows/Mac/Linux).

**Alternatively**, you will be able to use the university computers in the 
EDV room (for the git part only, unfortunately). If you haven't done so already, 
[request a linux account](https://orawww.uibk.ac.at/public_prod/owa/uvw$web$10.p001)
at ZID.


### Installing git

To install git, follow the instructions from the official website: 
[https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Once installed, you can check your installation by opening a terminal (on 
Windows, I recommend to use the newly installed ``Git Bash`` program which 
should be available in your windows "Start" menu) and type: 

    git --version
    
If the git software version shows up without error, you should be good to go.

### Installing Jekyll

Installing Jekyll should be fairly straightforward as well. Follow the 
instructions for your OS as described on the official website: 
[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

IF everything went well, you should be able to open a terminal (on windows: 
``Git Bash``) and type:

    jekyll -v
    
If the software version shows up without error, you should be able to run the 
following command, which will create a new website folder in the current
directory: 

     jekyll new jekyll-website
     

### Optional: creating a github account

If you plan to host your webpage on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
(free) or if you plan to use github for personal or open source projects,
I recommend to create a [github account](https://github.com/join). 
Personally, I run my github account [under my real name](https://github.com/fmaussion) 
and affiliation, because I consider github to be a professional platform and an extension 
of my CV.

Using github is not *necessary* in order to take full advantage of git. 
As will be discussed during the  workshop, there are alternative platforms such
as the [UIBK Gitlab](https://git.uibk.ac.at). Similarly, there
are alternatives to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting your 
webpage, even if github pages is probably the most convenient.
